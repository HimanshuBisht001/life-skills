# Learning Process

## Question 1 - What is the Feynman Technique? 
The Feynman Technique is a method for mastering complex topics by breaking them down into simple explanations. 


It involves:
- **Don't fool yourself**:
- **Choose a Topic**
- **Explain the concept using simple language**
- **Find Weak Spots**
- **Refine and Simplify**

## Question 2 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
I found the Pomodoro Technique to be an effective time management method:
1. **Set a Timer for 25 Minutes**: Focus on the task, like studying or working on a project, for 25 minutes without distractions.
2. **Take a 5-Minute Break**: Once the timer goes off, take a short 5-minute break to relax and recharge.
3. **Repeat**: Do this three more times—25 minutes of focused work followed by 5-minute breaks.
4. **Longer Break**: After four 25-minute sessions (about 2 hours), take a longer break, like 15-30 minutes.

## Question 3 - What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

1. **Active Mode**: I focus intently on a task, analyzing details and solving problems.

    -  **Example**:When I write an essay, I concentrate on structuring ideas and choosing words carefully.

2. **Diffused Mode**: I let my mind relax and allow ideas to flow freely, sparking creativity.

    -   **Example:** After taking a break from writing, I often return with fresh insights to improve my work
    
Both modes help me—Active Mode keeps me focused, while Diffused Mode encourages creativity.

## Question 4 - According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

1. Learn enough to self-correct.
2. Remove practice barriers(especially emotional).
3. Deconstruct into small parts.
4. Practice at least 20 hours.

## Question 5 - What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
1. **Master Concepts with the Feynman Technique**:  
    - I break down complex concepts into simple explanations.  
    - I focus on areas where my understanding is weak and clarify them..

2. **Enhance Focus with the Pomodoro Technique**:  
    - I work in focused 25-minute intervals followed by 5-minute breaks.  
    - After four intervals, I take a longer break of 15-30 minutes to recharge.

3. **Learn New Topics Effectively:**:  
    - I begin with foundational concepts and divide the topic into smaller, manageable sections. 
    - I consistently review and reflect on the material to solidify my understanding.
    - I start with basic concepts and divide the topic into smaller sections.
