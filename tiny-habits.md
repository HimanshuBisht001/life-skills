## Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P.

**B = MAP** is a behavior change model by BJ Fogg that simplifies building new habits by focusing on three key elements:

- **M (Motivation)**:  The willingness or desire to do a behavior. It can help with difficult tasks but isn't always reliable.
- **A (Ability)**: How simple or easy the behavior is to perform. Easier tasks need less motivation.
- **P (Prompt)**: A cue or reminder that triggers the behavior, such as completing one task leading to the next.


## Question 3: Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Celebrating after completing a habit helps make it stick by creating positive feelings. It makes the habit easier to repeat because your brain starts to connect it with feeling good. Celebrating also keeps you motivated and makes the habit more enjoyable, which helps you stay consistent. When you feel successful, you're more likely to keep going and build the habit over time.
